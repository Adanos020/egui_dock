- When dragging tabs onto the tab bar if the tab will be inserted a highlighted region will show where the tab will end up if dropped.
- The dock will keep track of the currently focused leaf.
- Using `Tree::push_to_focused_leaf` will push the given tab to the currently active leaf.
- `StyleBuilder` for the `Style`
- New fields in `Style:` `separator_color`, `border_color`, and `border_size` (last two for the cases when used `Margin`)
- `TabBuilder` for the `BuiltTab`
- Support for all implementations of `Into<WidgetText>` in tab titles
- Style editor in the `hello` example

## Changed

- If a tab is dropped onto the tab bar it will be inserted into the index that it is dropped onto.
- Now when you drag a tab it has an outline along the entire length of the edges of it

- Renamed `Style::border_size` to `Style::border_width`

## Fixed
