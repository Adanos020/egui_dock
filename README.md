Originally created by [@lain-dono](https://github.com/lain-dono), this library provides docking support for `egui`.
It lets you open and close tabs, freely move them around, insert them in selected parts of the `DockArea`, and resize them.

## How to contribute

Feel free to open new issues and pull requests.

Before contributing, please read [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Quick start

Add `egui` and `egui_dock` to your project's dependencies.

```toml
[dependencies]
egui = "0.22"
egui_dock = "0.6"
```

Then proceed by setting up `egui`, following its [quick start guide](https://github.com/emilk/egui#quick-start).
Once that's done, you can start using `egui_dock` â€“ more details on that can be found in the
[documentation](https://docs.rs/egui_dock/latest/egui_dock/).

## Alternatives

### [egui_tiles](https://https://github.com/rerun-io/egui_tiles) 

It's a library aiming to achieve similar goals in addition to being more flexible and customizable.

One feature it supports that `egui_dock` does not at the moment is the ability to divide nodes into more than two children,
enabling horizontal, vertical, and grid layouts.

> [!NOTE]
> `egui_tiles` is much earlier in development than `egui_dock` and doesn't yet support a lot of features.
