Credit goes to [@lain-dono](https://github.com/lain-dono) for implementing the actual library.

This fork aims to provide documentation and further development if necessary.

## How to contribute

Before contributing, please read [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Quick start

Add `egui_dock` to your project's dependencies.

```toml
[dependencies]
egui_dock = "0.2"
```

Instead of explicitly depending on `egui`, prefer using `egui_dock_::egui` since it is the compatible version.

Then proceed by setting up `egui`, following its [quick start guide](https://github.com/emilk/egui#quick-start).
Once that's done, you can start using `egui_dock` â€“ more details on that can be found in the
[documentation](https://docs.rs/egui_dock/latest/egui_dock/).
